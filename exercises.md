#### Example HTML/CSS Project exercise:

Even though you have seen previously HTML and CSS together in the same file, with the CSS _embedded_ into the HTML, is a better practice to separate them because this way we have all the CSS in one part and all the HTML in other part.

This way, if we need to make a change only related to styling, for example, we don't have to alter our HTML for any reason. Same if, for example, we just have to change the content of our HTML, we wouldn't touch styling intentionally or **by accident**.

This is known as **separation of concerns**.
